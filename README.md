# MsLisp #

MsLisp is a pet project to write an interpreter for a dialect of lisp that borrows heavily from Scheme and some of the better parts of Common Lisp.

The MsLisp project is the lisp engine, while the MsRepl project is the read-evaluate-print-loop. MsLispTests is a unit test project, with some independent lisp unit tests as well.
